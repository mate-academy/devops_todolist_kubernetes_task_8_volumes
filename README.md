# Django ToDo list

This is a to-do list web application with the basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).

## Task

Create a Kubernetes manifest for a pod that will contain a ToDo app container:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a `pv.yml` file for the `PersistentVolume` resource.
3. `PersistentVolume` requirements:
    1. `PersistentVolume` persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy `Delete`
    2. `PersistentVolume` class `standard`
    3. `PersistentVolume` accessModes `ReadWriteMany`
    4. `PersistentVolume` capacity `1Gi`
    5. `PersistentVolume` should use `hostPath`
1. Create a `pvc.yml` file for the `PersitentVolumeClaim` resource.
1. `PersitentVolumeClaim` requirements:
    1. `PersitentVolumeClaim` should claim a `PersistentVolume` from a pvc file.
    2. `Deployment` should use `PersistentVolume` through the `PersitentVolumeClaim`
    3. `PersistentVolume` mount path should be `/app/data`
1. Other Requirements
    1. Mount the existing configMap as a file into the `/app/configs` folder inside the container. It should be a read-only mount
    2. Mount existing secrets as files into the `/app/secrets` folder inside the container. It should be a read-only mount
1. `bootstrap.sh` should contain all the commands to deploy all the required resources in the cluster
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` should have instructions on how to validate:
    1. App is running
    1. ConfigMap data is mounted as files in the right order
    1. Secret data is mounted as a file
1. Create PR with your changes and attach it for validation on a platform.

### How to validate that App is running

```
kubectl get pods -n todoapp
```

### How to validate that ConfigMap data is mounted as files in a right order

```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n todoapp -- ls //app/configs
```

### How to validate that Secret data is mounted as file

```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n todoapp -- ls //app/secrets
```

### How to validate that How Output 'cat counter.txt' from a pod

```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n todoapp -- cat //app/data/counter.txt
```
